I am a recent alumni of the University of Central Florida, having majored in Information Technology. 
After graduation I spent some time working in Information Security at a Defense Contractor, until recently when I transitioned into a systems based role at an emerging company.

**Opinions and information expressed here are in no way related to that of my employer.** 

This site is purely for my personal musings. I just really enjoy what I do and would like to share some of the things I learn along the way in hopes that it helps others. 

I have a wide variety of technical interests ranging from reversing, programming, web development, and systems administration. 

My non-technical interests include photography, rocketry, and of course video games. I play a little bit of everything but spend far too much time playing rocket league.
