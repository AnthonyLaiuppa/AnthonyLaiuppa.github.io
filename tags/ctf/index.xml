        <description>Intro It&amp;rsquo;s 10:30PM on a Sunday night, and I&amp;rsquo;m wondering what to do with the last few hours of the weekend. Not feeling like working on project code and digging for bug bounty treasure is sounding tedious at the moment. A CTF however sounds like a good time, and a quick trip over to ctftime.org show there&amp;rsquo;s a CTF ongoing!
RGB CTF 2020 Theres a few categories here:
 Beginner - Cryptography - Forensics/OSINT - Misc - Pwn/Rev - Web - [ZTC]</description>

        <description>Preamble There are alot of reasons to look forward to the holiday season and the annual SANS Holiday Hacking Challenge is no exception. This year they went with a conference theme, where you sign into a virtual world and attend Kringlecon &amp;ndash; a mythical conference hosted by santa and his crack team of information security elves. SANS makes things very approachable by giving you smaller terminal challenges to solve in exchange for hints regarding the bigger objectives.</description>

        <description>Intro A little bit ago a friend sent me a link to a CTF put on by the Leap Security forum. It seems like there&amp;rsquo;s always a shortage of time so I was only able to get through one challenge, but I wanted to share anyways incase someone out there is wanting to play in CTF&amp;rsquo;s but doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel ready.
The Challenge So lets dive in, off the bat this challenge is in the reverse category and we&amp;rsquo;re met with the following code alongside the following hint.</description>

        <description>Intro Ever sit down to learn something and at first the examples are great, but then when it comes to getting advanced &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;re lost wondering what happened inbetween? When learning I always found it easy to get started, but hard to get anywhere meaningful as all the examples felt like this picture
It was always hard to find comprehensive code examples that covered a wide range of topics, so I figured I would share this project in hopes someone takes away some newfound information or motivation.</description>

        <description>Intro Continuing with my efforts of becoming better at CTFs I decided to participate in the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge. It is a pretty awesome challenge with a lovely pixelated game accompanying the tasks. It takes place in the North Pole and the gist of it is Santa is missing. The elfs were all kinds of helpful providing articles related to some of the tasks. I learned alot about some neat topics that I had little experience with, such a Android application Reverse Engineering and Password Cracking.</description>

        <description>Binary Fun: With basic binary file analysis A little bit ago I decided CTFs looked like alot of fun and that I want to get involved. At least for me it was a little daunting picking where to start. Some people would start with things they are familiar with but I thought Reverse Engineering sounded cool so I went with that. I got a small binary made by a friend, intended to be similar to a basic reversing challenge, to start with.</description>
