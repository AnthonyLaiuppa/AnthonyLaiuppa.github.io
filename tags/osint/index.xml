        <description>2020 Retrospective While migrating my site years later, it&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning theres alot of wonderful toolchains available now that really nail this. The biggest one being someone put in the work to properly parse the site-maps.
Intro Trying bug bounties can be fun, you might even walk off like a prospector with gold. Of course similar to sifting through river water looking for gold, youve got sifting through websites looking for things that catch your eye.</description>

        <description>Intro I was at work when I almost dropped a URL into goo.gl, you know because short URLs are awesome. However I stopped right before I dropped it in because Google was kind enough to tell me that all URLs shortened are public. Then it occured to me that just haphazardly dropping links in is of course an OPSec issue. With billions of shortened URLs in existence is it really though?</description>

        <description>Intro Continuing with my efforts of becoming better at CTFs I decided to participate in the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge. It is a pretty awesome challenge with a lovely pixelated game accompanying the tasks. It takes place in the North Pole and the gist of it is Santa is missing. The elfs were all kinds of helpful providing articles related to some of the tasks. I learned alot about some neat topics that I had little experience with, such a Android application Reverse Engineering and Password Cracking.</description>
