        <description>Intro The internet is chock full of information, and often times there is a need to aggregate it in order to gain insights through additional analysis. To that end, scraping information from the internet can become somewhat reptitive.
Here we&amp;rsquo;ll explore a simple approach to automating part of the process of writing the code to retrieve information from the web.
Overview With the bulk of the internet transitioning to more decoupled models we are seeing more and more API&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

        <description>Intro In 2019 I had my first opportunity to drive a Tesla Model 3. This cemented in my mind that it was a car years ahead of the automotive industry, and through technical analysis others seem to agree. Despite this I didn&amp;rsquo;t think to buy any stock, shortly after driving the car it shot up from $330 to over $900. This event fostered a deeper interest in finance, eventually resulting in this post.</description>

        <description>Intro While digging around on a bug bounty I came across a company&amp;rsquo;s subdomain that hosts a maze challenge. Probably for vetting interviewees.
Overview The instructions were pretty simple, and we get three endpoints to work with.
 Start - Returns an ~ID~ for the Maze, as well as ~Height~ and ~Width~ Check - Returns a 200 status code if the Maze location(x,y) you sent it is valid Solve - Returns a 200 if you solve the maze  The end of the maze is Height-1, Width-1</description>

        <title>Terraforming complete AWS-Kubernetes clusers</title>

        <description>Intro While working on getting better with Terraform I noticed there weren&amp;rsquo;t alot of examples of Kubernetes and AWS being provisioned at the same time. I forked the sample code provided by the Terraform project, and modularized it. From there I was able to add in a Kubernetes provider and patch in authentication. This allows us to create and provision Kubernetes architecture in AWS with a single command. To give a service to demonstrate, I&amp;rsquo;ve written a simple API endpoint in Golang and accompanying React front end.</description>

        <description>Intro Previously we virtualized a Kubernetes cluster on our localhost, but that is just simulating the cloud. Why dont we take GoKu to the actual cloud and see how it does? I actually tried to tie this in and scan the same 111 URLs from the last post, but it finished so fast I couldnt believe it. Lets bump things up a notch, what if we want to scan 5000+ sites?</description>

        <description>Intro Recently I sat down to learn more about Go and Kubernetes, and figured I would share some distributed computing fun had along the way. Youll notice the map tool from the previous post can be slow when getting statuses, we&amp;rsquo;ll use that as a starting point and refine it.
Overview Lets go over the core technologies at work here, starting with the most basic definition.
 Container: a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.</description>
