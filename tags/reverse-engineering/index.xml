        <description>Preamble There are alot of reasons to look forward to the holiday season and the annual SANS Holiday Hacking Challenge is no exception. This year they went with a conference theme, where you sign into a virtual world and attend Kringlecon &amp;ndash; a mythical conference hosted by santa and his crack team of information security elves. SANS makes things very approachable by giving you smaller terminal challenges to solve in exchange for hints regarding the bigger objectives.</description>

        <description>Binary Fun: With basic binary file analysis A little bit ago I decided CTFs looked like alot of fun and that I want to get involved. At least for me it was a little daunting picking where to start. Some people would start with things they are familiar with but I thought Reverse Engineering sounded cool so I went with that. I got a small binary made by a friend, intended to be similar to a basic reversing challenge, to start with.</description>
